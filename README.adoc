. Arranges an application as a collection of _loosely coupled services_.
In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained, and the protocols are lightweight

== DDD Part 1: Strategic Domain-Driven Design

#_Domain-Driven Design_# (DDD) has been around since Eric Evans published his book about the subject in 2003, this content is very much based on the books Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software by Eric Evans and Implementing Domain-Driven Design by Vaughn Vernon

=== What is a Domain

In case of domain-drive design can be represented by an "activity", this activity whatever an organization does and knowledge is how the organization does it, we have also the environment in which the organization conducts its activities to the domain concept.

==== Subdomains

Domain is a very broad and abstract concept, to make it more concrete and realistic, we need split it up into smaller parts called _subdomains_ but finding these subdomains is not always an easy thing to do... lets classify subdomain in categories such as:

. Core domains
. Supporting subdomains
. Generic subdomains

#_A core domain is what makes an organization special and different from other organizations_#.
An organization cannot succeed (or even exist) without being perfect in their core domain.
Because the core domain is so important, it should receive the highest priority, the biggest effort and the best developers.
For smaller domains you may only identify a single core domain, larger domains may have more than one.
You should be prepared to implement the features of the core domain from scratch

#_A supporting subdomain is a subdomain that is necessary for the organization to succeed_#, but it does not fall into the core domain category.
It is not generic either because #_it still requires some level of specialization_# for the organization in question.
You may be able to start with an existing solution and tweak it or extend it to your specific needs.

#_A generic subdomain is a subdomain that does not contain anything special to the organization but is still needed for the overall solution to work.
#You can save a lot of time and work by trying to use off-the-shelf software for your generic subdomains#.
A typical example would be user identity management.

It is worth noting that the same subdomain can fall into different categories depending on what the organization does.
For a company that specializes in identity management, identity management is a core domain.
However, for a company that specializes in customer relations management, identity management is a generic subdomain.

Finally, it is worth pointing out that all subdomains are important to the overall solution regardless of the category in which they fall.
They do, however, require different amounts of effort and may also have different requirements of quality and completeness.

- Example

Let’s say we are building an EMR (Electronic Medical Records) system for smaller clinics.
We have identified the following subdomains:

    Patient Records for managing patient medical records (personal information, medical history, etc.).

    Lab for ordering lab tests and managing test results.

    Scheduling for scheduling appointments.

    File Archive for storing and managing files that are attached to the patient records (such as different documents, X-ray pictures, scanned paper documents).

    Identity Management for making sure the right people have access to the right information.

To be able to create software for a domain, you need a way of describing the domain and #having a relational data model or something similar is not enough#, you need to be able to describe not only things and their relations but also the dynamics such as events, processes, business invariants, how things change over time, and so on, You need to be able to discuss and reason about the domain with both your fellow developers and also the domain experts.
What you need is a _ubiquitous language_.
The ubiquitous language is a language that is consistently used by both domain experts and developers to describe and discuss the domain, you can document the ubiquitous language in various ways.
A good starting point is to create a glossary of terms.
Business processes can be described graphically using e.g. swim-lane diagrams and flow charts.
UML can be used to describe the relationship between things and state diagrams to describe how state changes as different things move through different processes.
If you can easily explain a business concept or process using the language, it means you are on the right track.
If you, on the other hand, find your self struggling to explain something, you are most likely missing something from the language and thereby also from your domain model.
When this happens, you should grab a domain expert and go looking for the missing pieces.
Instead of trying to find the Big Unified Model, we choose to accept the facts and instead introduce something called bounded contexts.
A bounded context is a distinct part of the domain in which a particular subset or dialect of the ubiquitous language is consistent at all times, in other words, we are applying divide and conquer and splitting the domain model up into smaller, more or less independent models with clearly defined boundaries.
Every bounded context has its own name and this name is a part of the ubiquitous language.
We can to think about bounded contexts as separate systems (e.g. separate executable JARs or deployable WARs in the Java world).
#A perfect real-world example of this is microservices, where each microservice can be considered its own bounded context.#

If we are using the EMR as example we can describe such: The system supports services for both #doctor appointments# and #physiotherapy#.
In addition, there is a separate #onboarding# process for new #patients# where they are interviewed, photographed and given an initial assessment.
This leads to the following bounded contexts within the core domain:

image::architecture/thumb/contexts.png[]




. Personal information for managing the patient’s personal information (name, address, financial information, medical background, etc).
. Onboarding for introducing new patients into the system.
. Medical Exams used by doctors when examining and treating the patient.
. Physiotherapy used by physiotherapists when examining and treating the patient.

- Relationships Between Contexts

In a non-trivial system, very few (if any) bounded contexts are completely independent, #Most contexts will have some kind of relationship with other contexts.
Identifying these relationships is of importance not only technically (how will the systems technically communicate with each other) but also to how they are developed (how will the teams that develop the systems communicate with each other)#

Under the contexts Maps and Integration Patterns we have some questions

. Where are the context boundaries?
. How are the contexts going to communicate technically?
. How are we going to map between the context's domain models (i.e. how are we translating from one ubiquitous language to another)?
. How are we going to guard against unwanted or problematic changes occurring upstream?
. How are we going to avoid causing trouble for downstream contexts?

== DDD Part 2. Tactical Domain-Driven Design

. Compared to strategic domain-driven design, tactical design is much more hands-on and closer to the actual code.
Strategic design deals with abstract wholes whereas tactical design deals with classes and modules, The purpose of tactical design is to refine the domain model to a stage where it can be converted into working code, design is an iterative process and so it makes sense to combine strategic and tactical design.
. One of the most important concepts in tactical DDD is the *value object.*, value objects should always be made _immutable_, instead of changing the state of the value object, you replace it with a new instance.
For complex value objects, consider using the builder or essence pattern.
. Value objects are not only containers of data - they can also contain business logic.
The fact that the value objects are also immutable makes the business operations both thread-safe and side-effect free This is one of the reasons I like value objects so much and why you should try to model as many of your domain concepts as possible as value objects.
Also, try to make the value objects as small and as coherent as possible - this makes them easier to maintain and reuse

=== Value Objects

[source,java]
----
class Currency {
    private final Money balance; // bring the context to the value
}

class Money implements Serializable, Comparable<Money> {

    private BigDecimal amount;

    Money add(Money other) {}


}

enum Currency {
    USD, BRL
}

class Email {
    @Email
    private final String address;
}


@Builder
@AllArgsConstructor
class StreetAddress implements Serializable, Comparble<StreetAddress> {
    final String city;
    final String streetAddress;

    final Country country;
    final PostalCode postalCode;
}

----

. The second important concept in tactical DDD and the sibling to value objects is the *entity*.
An entity is an object whose identity is of importance.
As opposed to value objects, entities are mutable.
However, that does not mean you should create setter methods for every property

=== Entities

[source,java]
----
class Person {
    final PersonId personId; // VO is used fot the Entity ID
    final PersonName personName;
    final StreetAddress address;
}

class PersonId {
    final String indentifer;
}
----

. A basic comparison based on DDD Interface

Company A:

    The manager looks up the employee’s record in the system.

    The manager selects the 'Terminate Employment Contract' action.

    The system asks for the termination date and reason.

    The manager enters the needed information and clicks 'Terminate Contract'.

    The system automatically updates the employee records, revokes the employee’s user credentials and electronic office key and sends a notification to the payroll system.

Company B:

    The manager looks up the employee’s record in the system.

    The manager puts a check in the 'Contract terminated' checkbox and enters the termination date, then clicks 'Save'.

    The manager logs into the user management system, looks up the user’s account, puts a check in the 'Disabled' checkbox and clicks 'Save'.

    The manager logs into the office key management system, looks up the user’s key, puts a check in the 'Disabled' check box and clicks 'Save'.

    The manager sends an e-mail to the payroll department notifying them that the employee has quit.

=== Aggregates

. Now when we know what entities and value objects are, we are going to look at the next important concept: aggregates.
An aggregate is a group of entities and value objects that have certain characteristics:

.Aggregate Definition
image::architecture/thumb/aggregate.png[]



. In addition, there are two important restrictions concerning aggregates:

    An aggregate can be referenced from the outside through its root only. Objects outside of the aggregate may not reference any other entities inside the aggregate.

    The aggregate root is responsible for enforcing business invariants inside the aggregate, ensuring that the aggregate is in a consistent state at all times.

.Aggregate References
image::architecture/thumb/aggregate_references.png[]

This means that whenever you design an entity, you have to decide what kind of entity you are going to make: will the entity act as an aggregate root, or will it be what I call a local entity that lives inside an aggregate and under the supervision of an aggregate root?
Since local entities cannot be referenced from outside the aggregate, it is enough that their IDs are unique within the aggregate (they have a local identity)

- How is the entity going to be accessed in the application?
- If the entity will be looked up by ID or through some kind of search it is probably an aggregate root.
- Will other aggregates need to reference it?
- If the entity will be referenced from within other aggregates it is definitely an aggregate root.
- How is the entity going to be modified in the application?
- If it can be modified independently it is probably an aggregate root.
- If it cannot be modified without making changes to another entity it is probably a local entity.

A business invariant is a rule that must always hold regardless of what happens to the aggregate.
A simple business invariant could be that in an invoice, the total amount must always be the sum of the amounts of the line items

==== Guideline for Aggregates

. Aggregates are always retrieved and stored as a whole.
The less data you have to read and write, the better your system will perform
. Instead of referencing another aggregate directly, create a value object that wraps the ID of the aggregate root and use that as the reference
. Try to design your operations so that you only make changes to one aggregate inside a single transaction.

.Microservices change different aggregates in same transaction

===== Aggregation Sample

[source,java]
----
import java.util.List;
class Order extends AggregateRoot<OrderId> {
    private CustomerId customer;
    private String shippingName;
    private PostalAddress shippingAddress;
    private String billingName;
    private PostalAddress billingAddress;
    private Money total;
    private Long nextFreeItemId;
    private List<OrderItem> items = new ArrayList<>();
}
----

== Domain Events

So far we have only looked at the "things" in the domain model.
However, these can only be used to describe the static state that the model is in at any given moment.
In many business models, you also need to be able to describe things that happen and change the state of the model.
For this, you can use domain events.
Domain events were not included in Evans' book about domain driven-design.
They have been added to the toolbox later and are included in Vernon’s book.
A domain event is anything that happens in the domain model that may be of interest to other parts of the system

Domain events typically have the following characteristics:

- They are immutable (after all, you can’t change the past).
- They have a timestamp when the event in question occurred.
- They may have a unique ID that helps to distinguish one event from another.
This depends on the type of event and how the events are distributed.
- They are published by aggregate roots or domain services (more about those later).
The publisher is not aware of what happens with the event, nor should the listener be able to affect the publisher (in other words, publishing domain events should be side-effect free from the point of view of the publisher). *Because of this, it is recommended that domain event listeners do not run inside the same transaction that published the event.*
#_Most parts of a typical business system will not require event sourcing, but some parts do.
Forcing the entire system to use event sourcing as a persistence model would, in my opinion, be overkill_#

=== Distributing Domain Events

- Domain events are only usable if you have a reliable way of distributing them to listeners.
Inside a monolith, you can handle the distribution in-memory by using the standard observer patter.
However, even in this case you may need something more sophisticated if you follow the good practice of running the event publishers inside separate transactions.
What if one of the event listeners fail and the event must be re-sent?
